You have access to the following tool to help answer the question. <tool_description> Documentation Search Engine Tool * The search engine will exclusively search over software Documentation for pages similar to your query.

Use this tool if you want to get up-to-date and comprehensive information on a topic to help answer queries. Queries should be as atomic as possible -- they only need to address one part of the user's question. For example, if the user's query is "what is the color of a basketball?", your search query should be "basketball". Here's another example: if the user's question is "Who created the first neural network?", your first query should be "neural network". As you can see, these queries are quite short.
